# This is an example .gitlab-ci.yml file to test (and optionally report the
# coverage
# results of) your [Julia][1] packages. Please refer to the [documentation][2]
# for more information about package development in Julia.
#
# Here, it is assumed that your Julia package is named `MyPackage`. Change it to
# whatever name you have given to your package.

# Below is the template to run your tests in Julia
.test_template: &test_definition
  # Uncomment below if you would like to run the tests on specific references
  # only, such as the branches `master`, `development`, etc.
  # only:
  #   - master
  #   - development

    # Let's run the tests. Substitute `coverage = false` below, if you do not
    # want coverage results.

# Name a test and select an appropriate image.
# images comes from Docker hub
test:1.0:
  tags:
    - docker

  image: julia:1.0.5
  <<: *test_definition

test:1.3:
  tags:
    - docker
  image: julia:1.3.1
  <<: *test_definition


# Maybe you would like to test your package against the development branch:
# test:1.1-dev (not sure there is such an image in docker, so not tested yet):
#  image: julia:v1.1-dev
#  # ... allowing for failures, since we are testing against the development
#  # branch:
#  allow_failure: true
#  <<: *test_definition

# REMARK: Do not forget to enable the coverage feature for your project, if you
# are using code coverage reporting above. This can be done by
#
# - Navigating to the `CI/CD Pipelines` settings of your project,
# - Copying and pasting the default `Simplecov` regex example provided, i.e.,
#   `\(\d+.\d+\%\) covered` in the `test coverage parsing` textfield.

# Example documentation deployment
#pages:
#  image: julia:0.7
#  stage: deploy
#  script:
#    - apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y git  # needed by Documenter
#    - julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.clone(pwd()); Pkg.build("MyPackage");'  # rebuild Julia (can be put somewhere else I'm sure
#    - julia -e 'using Pkg; import MyPackage; Pkg.add("Documenter")'  # install Documenter
#    - julia --color=yes docs/make.jl  # make documentation
#    - mv docs/build public  # move to the directory picked up by Gitlab pages
#  artifacts:
#    paths:
#      - public
#  only:
#    - master
