	abstract = {We present a polynomial quantum algorithm for the Abelian stabilizer problem which includes both factoring and the discrete logarithm. Thus we extend famous Shor's results. Our method is based on a procedure for measuring an eigenvalue of a unitary operator. Another application of this procedure is a polynomial quantum Fourier transform algorithm for an arbitrary finite Abelian group. The paper also contains a rather detailed introduction to the theory of quantum computation.},

	title = {An improved quantum Fourier transform algorithm and applications},
	doi = {10.1109/SFCS.2000.892139},
	abstract = {We give an algorithm for approximating the quantum Fourier transform over an arbitrary Z/sub p/ which requires only O(n log n) steps where n=log p to achieve an approximation to within an arbitrary inverse polynomial in n. This improves the method of A.Y. Kitaev (1995) which requires time quadratic in n. This algorithm also leads to a general and efficient Fourier sampling technique which improves upon the quantum Fourier sampling lemma of L. Hales and S. Hallgren (1997). As an application of this technique, we give a quantum algorithm which finds the period of an arbitrary periodic function, i.e. a function which may be many-to-one within each period. We show that this algorithm is efficient (polylogarithmic in the period of the function) for a large class of periodic functions. Moreover, using standard quantum lower-bound techniques, we show that this characterization is right. That is, this is the maximal class of periodic functions with an efficient quantum period-finding algorithm.},
