\section{Grover search use-case}
The Grover search algorithm

\subsection{Introduction}
General idea


\subsection{Quantum circuit description and construction}
Require methods and how it works
 
\subsection{Testing procedure}
Why we do this and how to test

\subsubsection{Validation}
Discuss implemented use-case 

\subsubsection{Benchmarking}
Circuit depth and performance testing 

\subsubsection{Tasks}
Sketch of the tasks envisaged to implement this use cases are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Script to generate QASM for QFT circuit with a given number of qubits
\item Script to generate QASM for ansatz circuit of given size and parameters (or to allow simulator start from arbitrary input state)
\item Script to run simulator and calculate output amplitudes for a set of configurations
\item Script to compare amplitudes and estimate the accuracy of the simulation
\item Ability to accurately record run time
\item Collate timings and accuracies, plot results and document conclusions
\end{enumerate}
